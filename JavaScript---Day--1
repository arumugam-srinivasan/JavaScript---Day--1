Introduction:
HTTP is the fundamental protocol that enables the exchange of information between web servers and clients.
As the digital landscape continues to evolve,
it becomes essential to understand the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and its successor, HTTP/2.

The Foundation:
HTTP/1.1 has been the workhorse of the internet for over a decade. It operates on a request-response model, where each element of a webpage,
be it HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, requires a separate connection to the server. This leads to a phenomenon known as the "head-of-line blocking,
" where subsequent requests are held up until the current one is completed.

HTTP/2, developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
was introduced to overcome the limitations of its predecessor and provide a more efficient and faster web experience. 
It introduces several optimizations to address the challenges posed by HTTP/1.1.

Conclusion:
In summary, the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents a major leap in the world of web communication. HTTP/2's multiplexing, header compression,
and other optimizations contribute to a faster and more efficient web experience. As the internet continues to evolve,
understanding these protocol differences becomes crucial for web developers, system administrators, and anyone interested in the intricacies of web performance.
